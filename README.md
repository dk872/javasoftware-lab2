# Java_software-lab2

## Description
This project provides a text processing utility that replaces words of a specified length in a given text with a custom replacement string. It is implemented in Java using `StringBuilder` for efficient string manipulation and includes input validation and exception handling. 

## Calculation of the task variant
Number in the group list: **15**;

C3 = 15 % 3 = **0**;

C17 = 15 % 17 = **15**;

## Features
- Replace words of a given length with a defined replacement string.  
- Preserve punctuation, spaces, and formatting.  
- Support for words with apostrophes (`'`, `â€™`).  
- Input validation with clear error messages.  
- Efficient processing using `StringBuilder`.
